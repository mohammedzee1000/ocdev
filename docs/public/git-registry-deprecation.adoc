= Deprecation of git based Registries

As we now have OCI based registries for devfiles, git based registries are being #deprecated#.

You are hereby advised to move to OCI based registry at the earliest as support for git based will be dropped in future releases.

OCI based registries can be setup on any kubernetes cluster using https://github.com/devfile/registry-operator[devfile registry operator].

An example of a devfile registry can be seen in the new https://registry.devfile.io[default devfile registry].
